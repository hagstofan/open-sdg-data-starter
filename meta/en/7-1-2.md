indicator_definition: "Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels\
  \ and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies\
  \ for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any\
  \ cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. \u201CClean\u201D is defined\
  \ by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed\
  \ coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor\
  \ air quality: household fuel combustion."

national_indicator_available: Percentage of population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking
national_geographical_coverage: Iceland
computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: Access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as “access to clean fuels and technologies” rather than “access to non-solid fuels.” This shift will help ensure that health and other “nexus” benefits are better counted, and thus realized.
computation_calculations: >-
  Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746 - per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global estimates.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
