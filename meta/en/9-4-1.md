national_indicator_available: CO2 emissions intensity by industry
national_indicator_description: >-
  Carbon dioxide intensity is calculated by dividing the level of carbon dioxide emissions by gross value added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Value added is inflation corrected and reported in 2010 USD.
