national_indicator_available: Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area
national_indicator_description: "Land is divided into five quality groups depending on the condition of vegetation and soil quality. The higher the group number the more ecological activity there is in the area.
Group 1: Areas with limited ecological activity and/or little stability and high degradation. 
Group 2: Areas with little stability and/or little ecological activity
Group 3: Areas where some or considerable ecological activity and considerable degradation OR areas with little activity and little degradation, e.g. moss grown lava fields. 
Group 4: Areas with medium ecological activity and/or stability but with little degradation OR areas with much ecological activity and considerable stability but some degradation. 
Group 5: Areas with much ecological activity and little degradation. "

computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: The methodology of the land quality assessment is detailed in this[report on the assessment of the quality of vegetation and soil resources in Iceland](https://grolind.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GroLind_stodumat_18_06_2020.pdf) 
comments_limitations: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop Icelandic data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
