**Non-statistical indicator**

We have identified the following policies relevant to this indicator.

[Law No 49/1997](https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/1997049.html) - On protections against avalanches and landslides

[Regulation No 505/2000](https://www.reglugerd.is/reglugerdir/allar/nr/505-2000) - On risk assessment due to avalanches, classification and utilization of risk prone areas and development of provisional risk assessment

[Regulation No 636/2009](https://www.reglugerd.is/reglugerdir/eftir-raduneytum/umhverfisraduneyti/nr/15581) - On risk assessment due to avalanches in ski resorts

The [Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management](https://www.almannavarnir.is/english/) is responsible for risk reduction and disaster response

Currently national risk reduction strategies that are in line with the Sendai Framework are only in place for avalances and landslides. However there are currently committees in place which are working on risk reduction strategies for volcanic eruptions and jokulhlaups as well as coastal and river flooding.
