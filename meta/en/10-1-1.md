The results are a three year average at price levels of the last year except during the years 2011-2016 where results are based on a four year average due to poor research responses in the years 2013-2015. Income data are from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, more information on the survey can be found [here](https://hagstofa.is/utgafur/lysigogn/lysigogn/?fileId=56788)
