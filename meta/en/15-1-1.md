  The UN identifies a forest as “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ". This classification excludes a large portion of natural Icelandic birch forests, thus information about the coverage of woodlands where trees to not reach 5m of height are also reported. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
