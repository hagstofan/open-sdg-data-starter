computation_definitions: >-
  Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
computation_calculations: The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
