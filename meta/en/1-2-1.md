computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >- 
  Iceland does not have an official poverty line. However, those at risk of poverty are defined as those with income below 60% of the median yearly disposable income. This measurement mainly reflects the idea that poverty is relative, i.e. poverty is a deficiency or exclusion which is a result of low income and that people under the above mentioned limits do not have enough resources to enjoy the same quality of life as is considered normal in the society in which they live.
