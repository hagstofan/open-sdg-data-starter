Statistics Iceland collects information on the skills of people in various fields of IT
as part of a pan-European Information Society Statistics study. Statistics Iceland
started this data collection again in 2017 after pausing for several years. In the study,
such skills are analysed in four areas, i.e. 1) acquisition and retention of information;
2) communication; 3) system skills; and 4) software. People’s skills in each field are
assessed on a three-step scale: 1) lack basic skills; 2) basic skills; 3) more than basic
skills. Finally, a composite indicator of general skills is created that takes into account
the skills of people in different fields.

There is a correlation between age and skills in the use of information technology,
i.e. almost everyone under the age of 45 has basic skills in all areas, but the skills
decrease with each increasing age group. Nevertheless, basic skills in all areas are
common in the older age groups.
