Since 2002, all residents of Iceland are considered to benefit from waste collection
and in that context it should be borne in mind that the obligation of local authorities with regard to the collection and transport of household waste (refuse) is clear, [cf. Art. 8 of Act No. 55/2003, on Handling of Waste.](https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2003055.html)
