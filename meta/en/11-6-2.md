computation_definitions: >-
  The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is  expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [Î¼g/m3 ]. Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases.
computation_calculations: The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with ground measurements.
comments_limitations: Particulate matter concentrations are measured in three locations in the capital area as well as in Akureyri. Measurement station annual averages are reported if 75% of daily averages are collected. This indicator reports the populated weighted average levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in the Capital area and Akureyri. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
