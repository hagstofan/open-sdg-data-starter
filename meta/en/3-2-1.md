indicator: 3.2.1
indicator_definition: The probability of a child born in a specific year or period
  dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates
  of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as
  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided
  by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability
  of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births.

target: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of
  age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000

computation_definitions: Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1,000 live births.
computation_calculations: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the number of live births for the same year. Both the numbers of deaths of children below 5 years of age, in this case involving the addition of Infant deaths (under 1 year of age) and deaths amongst children aged 1-4, and live births for a specific year can be drawn from the yearly Childhood Mortality statistics, dating back to 1961.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
