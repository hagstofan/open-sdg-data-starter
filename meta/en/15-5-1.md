national_geographical_coverage: Iceland
computation_units: Index
computation_definitions: The Icelandic Institute for Natural History compiles Red Lists for the biota of Iceland. The IINH has published Red Lists for [vascular plants](https://en.ni.is/node/27842), [birds](https://en.ni.is/node/27843), and [mammals](https://en.ni.is/node/27844).
computation_calculations: The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for ‘Near Threatened’ to 5 for ‘Extinct’ and ‘Extinct in the Wild’) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the ‘Extinct’ category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value. Mathematically this calculation is expressed as - RLIt = 1 – [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)], where Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for ‘Critically Endangered’ = 4, ‘Endangered’ = 3, ‘Vulnerable’ = 2, ‘Near Threatened’ = 1, ‘Least Concern’ = 0. ‘Critically Endangered’ species tagged as ‘Possibly Extinct’ or ‘Possibly Extinct in the Wild’ are assigned a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to ‘Extinct’ or ‘Extinct in the Wild’ species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be ‘Extinct’ in the year the set of species was first assessed.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
