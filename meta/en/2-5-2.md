The data for this indicator comes from the Icelandic Genetic Resource Council

Out of the seven Icelandic livestock breeds four are considered to be at risk of extinction: Goats, Leader Sheep (forystuf√©), Hens and the Icelandic sheepdog.

A nationwide plan for protection of genetic resources in Icelandic nature and agriculture is available [here](http://www.lbhi.is/sites/lbhi.is/files/gogn/vidhengi/rannsoknur/landsaaetlun_2019-2023_lres.pdf)
