  Estimated number of annual all-cause adult mortality attributable to anthropogenic (human-made) particulate air pollution (measured as fine particulate matter, PM2.5). Mortality burden associated with long-term exposure to anthropogenic particulate air pollution at current levels, expressed as the number of annual deaths from all causes. PM2.5 means the mass (in micrograms) per cubic metre of air of individual particles with an aerodynamic diameter generally less than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 is also known as fine particulate matter.

comments_limitations: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop Icelandic data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Reported is an estimated value by the European Environment Agency based on measurements of particulate matter concentrations in ambient air.
