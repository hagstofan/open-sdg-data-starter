According to the [Regulation on import, cultivation and distribution of foreign plant species no. 583/2000](https://www.reglugerd.is/reglugerdir/allar/nr/583-2000) it is illegal to import the following plant species: Azolla filiculoides, Bunias orientalis, Elodea canadensis, Fallopia japonica, Fallopia sachalinensis, Galinsoga quadriradiata, Heracleum persicum, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Heracleum sp., Impatiens parviflora, Petasites hybridus, Senecio inaequidens, Solidago canadensis, Solidago gigantea and Spartina anglica. It is also illegal to grow foreign plant species in protected areas, in protected landscapes and everywhere above 400 meters above sea level.

Iceland is also a member of the [NOBANIS](https://nobanis.org/) project. The project is a cooperation between Northern European countries to reduce or prevent damage due to invasive species. The Icelandic Institute of Natural History participates in the NOBANIS project on behalf of Iceland. The main goal of NOBANIS is to act as a regional portal for sharing information on exotic and invasive species in North and Central Europe and to make this data available online. The resources accessible through the portal include information on the number of invasive or potentially invasive species in Iceland.
