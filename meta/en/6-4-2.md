  The Water Exploitation Index (WEI) presented here shows the annual total fresh water abstraction in a country as a percentage of its long term annual average available water from renewable fresh water resources. This includes water removed from any fresh water source, either permanently or temporarily, as well as mine and drainage water and water abstractions from precipitation. Water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
