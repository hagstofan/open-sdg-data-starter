Land cover classifications are available for Iceland from the [CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment)](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover) inventory produced by the Copernicus programme. The classifications are updated every 6 years and contain information on a wide variety of land cover classes, including: lakes & reservoirs (CORINE class 512) , rivers & estuaries (CORINE classes 511 and 512) and wetlands (CORINE classes 411, 412 and 421).
