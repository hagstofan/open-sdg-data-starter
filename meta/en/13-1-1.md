  Deaths attributable to natural disasters, expressed per 100,000 population. The causes of death are registered as due to exposure to forces of nature and include: X30 Exposure to excessive natural heat, X31 Exposure to excessive natural cold, X32 Exposure to sunlight, X34 Earthquake, X35 Volcanic eruption, X36 Avalanche, landslide and other earth movements, X37 Cataclysmic storm, X38 Flood, X39 Exposure to other forces of nature. Of these only X31 Exposure to excessive natural cold and X36 Avalanche, landslide and other earth movements have been recorded in Iceland since 1996. 
computation_calculations: (Number of deaths / Population) * 1,000,000
comments_limitations: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop Icelandic data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
