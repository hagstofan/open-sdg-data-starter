computation_definitions: >-
  Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are won by members in general parliamentary elections. 
computation_calculations: The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament. There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.
