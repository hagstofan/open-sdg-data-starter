national_indicator_available: Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 100,000 population.
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health
  outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

computation_units: Rate per 100,000 population
computation_definitions: >-
  Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 1,000,000 population; The included diseases are the WASH attributable fractions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10
  code B76-B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46).
computation_calculations: Number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 100,000.
comments_limitations: Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
