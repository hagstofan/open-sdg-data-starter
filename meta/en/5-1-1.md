[The Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights for Males and Females, No. 10/2008,](https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008010.html) aims to establish and maintain equality and equal opportunities for women and men and thus equalise the position of women and men in all areas of society. It also stipulates how to promote, enforce and monitor gender equality and non-discrimination based on gender.
