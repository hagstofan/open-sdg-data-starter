indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_definition: Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will
  die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality
  rates of that period, expressed per 1,000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early
  neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths,
  occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

computation_definitions: Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days. 
computation_calculations: Where rates were not provided in the source data, the following calculation was carried out -  (Number of neonatal deaths / number of live births) * 1,000
